Zachary Klosko is a Richmond-based writer and broadcast engineer.
He is currently pursuing a degree in Digital Journalism at Virginia Commonwealth University. Outside of class, he keeps busy with A/V production, keeping WRIR (a Richmond community radio station) running, and contributing to open-source software on Github.

He got his first Washington Post article published in October of 2020 about Del. Elizabeth Guzman's, D-Woodbridge, efforts to secure paid leave for those needing to quarantine due to the Coronavirus. The same story was published by the Associated Press and Virginia Public Media.

He also had the opportunity to deploy Libretime, an open-source radio automation platform, at WRIR, allowing station volunteers to schedule playout of recorded shows while social distancing. The deployment allowed WRIR to remain operational during a temporary closure when a volunteer contracted COVID-19, a groundbreaking achievement for the station.

When he isn't working hard to advance the field of journalism and storytelling at the community level, he likes baking bread from scratch, biking through the city, and blasting disco house in the shower. If you want to buy him a coffee, he likes dark roasts and vanilla lattes.

He is available for hire. [Contact him here](/contact).
