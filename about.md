Zachary Klosko is a Richmond-based writer and broadcast engineer.
He is currently pursuing a degree in Digital Journalism at Virginia Commonwealth
University. Outside of class, he keeps busy with A/V production, keeping
WRIR (a local Richmond community radio station) running, and contributing to
open-source software on Github.

He recently got his first article published in The Washington Post about
Del. Guzman's efforts to secure paid leave for those needing to quarantine
due to the Coronavirus.

He also had the opportunity to deploy Libretime, an open-source radio automation
platform, at WRIR, allowing station volunteers to schedule playout of recorded
shows while social distancing. The deployment allowed WRIR to remain operational
during a temporary closure when a volunteer contracted COVID-19, a groundbreaking
achievement for the station.

When he isn't working hard to advance the field of journalism and storytelling
at the community level, he likes baking bread from scratch, biking through the city,
and blasting disco house in the shower. If you want to buy him a coffee, he likes
dark roasts and vanilla lattes.

He is available for hire. [Contact him here](/contact).
