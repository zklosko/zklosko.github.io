RICHMOND, Va. -- After [decriminalizing simple marijuana possession](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB2) in May of 2020, Gov. Ralph Northam is looking to further relax penalties for drug-related charges.

Northam plans to introduce legislation to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, according to a [press release](https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/november/headline-861390-en.html) published on Tuesday.

“It’s time to legalize marijuana in Virginia,” Northam said in the press release. “I look forward to working with the General Assembly to get this right.”

Northam said he wants legislation to include substance abuse prevention and prohibiting smoking marijuana indoors in public places, according to the press release. Northam also promised to “lead with a focus on equity,” noting the impact marijuana criminalization has had on minority communities.

Black Virginians were arrested for possession of marijuan at more than three times the rate of white individuals over the last decade, according to a [report](http://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2020-marijuana-legalization.asp) by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. The commission suggested the creation of an automatic expungement process for criminal records of past marijuana charges.

Del. Elizabeth Guzmán, D-Woodbridge, enthusiastically said she supports Northam’s efforts to legalize marijuana possession. She suggested a potential marijuana tax could be used to fund paid sick leave for employees using grants for small businesses.

“We’re struggling here in Virginia,” Guzmán said. “We don’t have the same revenue we had in the past.”

Guzmán has introduced multiple bills to secure paid sick leave to the General Assembly.

The next legislative session for the General Assembly begins on Jan. 13.
