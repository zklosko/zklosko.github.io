RICHMOND, Va. -- RVA Hospitality ran four high-end restaurants focused on the in-person dining experience in the Richmond area, according to manager Liz Kincaid. Then, the coronavirus brought business to a halt.

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam allowed the City of Richmond to enter Phase One on June 2, according to executive order 61. In Phase One, restaurants may only seat guests outside if guests are seated 6 feet apart. Restaurants were allowed to enter Phase Two on June 12, allowing restaurants to operate at 50% capacity while seating guests inside, according to executive order 65.

RVA Hospitality’s business suffered during the forced switch to take-out and delivery by Phase One according to Kincaid. Despite Richmond currently being in Phase Two, RVA Hospitality’s three restaurants in Richmond’s Arts District remain closed. Kincaid said she worries that guests won’t come back to dine in.

“For us, it wasn’t about Phase One,” Kincaid said. “There’s no one to feed down there.”

Hotels and businesses in Richmond began closing their doors in March in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Restaurants have had to shut their doors too, lacking a steady stream of guests. As restaurants in Richmond reopen, location proves to be the deciding factor in their ability to survive, according to multiple restaurant managers.

Garnett’s Cafe on Park Avenue is a local hole-in-the-wall eatery known for its sandwiches and old-school fare. Owner John Murden is confident that Garnett’s unique location, sandwiched between a group of townhouses, street corner and local park has helped him keep a steady stream of business.

“People are looking for stuff closer to the house,” Murden said. “We’re embedded.”

In response to the coronavirus, Murden fully switched Garnett’s to take-out only. Guests responded by taking their to-go orders to Meadow Park across the street, giving them a place to “eat out.”

“It’s given us a chance to provide something normal for everybody,” Murden said.

The Hop Craft Pizza & Beer, located on West Cary Street, has also benefited from outdoor seating. Manager Evan Byrne credits The Hop’s success during the Coronavirus pandemic with how prepared the restaurant was to handle take-out before the stay at home order.

The Hop started allowing guests to order food online when the restaurant opened in 2018, according to Byrne. The restaurant also sold beer in to-go orders.

Byrne’s Phase Two plans for The Hop include hand sanitizer at every table, requiring guests to wear masks when not eating and only seating guests outside. Byrne is cautious about Phase Two but isn’t willing to close the 2-year-old restaurant. Byrne says he is concerned that a lack of income would close the restaurant for good.

“We’re new and fresh, and still we couldn’t afford to close,” Byrne said. “I think it turned out to be the right move.”

While Garnett’s and The Hop appear to be staying afloat, RVA Hospitality has lost $50,000 in potential business each month, according to Kincaid. Despite the loss, Kincaid says it’s better than staying open with no customers.

“We would lose more money per month if we had people and food in the restaurant being sold,” Kincaid said.
